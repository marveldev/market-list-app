// initialize dexie
// create the object store and the version of that store
// the needed values for the object store is added when created.
// the id will be auto increamented by dexie

// useLiveQuery is a dexie-react-hook function, it allows us to:
// 1. to get data from the items object store and watch for changes.
// 2. allItems variable will be updated when there is a change to the item object store.
// 3. the component will then re-render the new data.

// the useLiveQuery hook expects a function and an array of its dependencies(if any).
// in this case, we are accessing the data from our items object store and converting to an array.
// if unavailable or still loading, then return null.

// the add() is used to add values to the created object store

// the delete() is used to remove a particular key/id from the object store

//the update() edits a particular key/id value in the object store
// update() method expects the itemâ€™s primary key as its first argument and the new object data as its second argument.
// Question: what happens when i want to edit a range of ids value.
